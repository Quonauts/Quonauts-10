Replace, in %buildings, the text
> Buildings may have a power cost. If the owner of a building has enough fuel to do so, they may make that building "in use" by announcing "Activate (name of building)" in <#720657721371918397>. After coming in use, and every hour after that, the owner of that building loses fuel equal to its power cost. It remains in use until its owner announces "Deactivate (name of building)", or they have insufficient fuel to power it for the next hour.
with 
> Buildings may have a power cost in fuel. If so, all operations using this building, unless otherwise specified, consume the specified amount of fuel to take place, and cannot take place if this requirement is not met. Buildings may also declare different power costs per operation.
Replace, in %furnace, the text
> Power cost: 50 fuel/hour

## #6

Players may conduct polls to informally gather opinions about any game relevant topic, called "opinion polls". An opinion poll may only be created by a player if no other opinion poll by that player is currently open.

An opinion poll must clearly state that it is an opinion poll. By default, the allowed reactions of an opinion poll are 👍 (in favor of the poll) and 👎 (against the poll), but the opinion poll may specify different allowed reactions for itself.

Add a new rule %lol: if the term "quantity" is in the rules, change it to "quality", unless it is in %lol.
